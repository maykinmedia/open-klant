The Open Klant project was initiated by Municipality of The Hague to store
a minimal set of data and metadata about clients and conversations with 
clients, in compliance with privacy and security regulations.

Open Klant is a registration component to re-use client data within the whole 
municipality, following with the Common Ground principles.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Open Forms that much 
better:

    Steven Bal
    Alex de Landgraaf
    Nathanael Gey
    Bart van der Schoor
    ErhanCitil
    Joeri Bekker
    Bart Burgmans

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    All municipalities who participated and risked implementing an API 
    specification that was not yet finalized by VNG.

    All people behind Common Ground for their enthusiasm and vision.
