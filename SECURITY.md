# Security policy

The development team is strongly committed to responsible reporting and 
disclosure of security-related issues. As such, we've adopted and follow a set 
of policies which conform to that ideal and are geared toward allowing us to 
deliver timely security updates to the official distribution of Open Klant.

## Reporting security issues

**Short version: Please report security issues by emailing security@maykinmedia.nl.**

If you discover security issues in Open Klant or related projects under the 
same organization, we request you to disclose these in a *responsible* way by 
mailing to security@maykinmedia.nl.

It is extremely useful if you have a reproducible test case and/or clear steps 
on how to reproduce the vulnerability.

Please do not report security issues on the public Github issue tracker, as 
this makes it visible which exploits exist before a fix is available, 
potentially comprising a lot of unprotected instances.

Once you've submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment 
from a member of the security team as soon as possible, and depending on the 
action to be taken, you may receive further followup emails.

## Timeline of the process

Open Klant community support is provided by 
[Maykin](https://www.maykinmedia.nl). The community support team is responsible 
for the handling of security issues.

1. The recipients of the report first validate if there is indeed a (possible) 
   issue.

2. After validation, we confirm that we received the report and if it is indeed
   a valid issue.

3. We have a private Github repository accessible only to the community support 
   team. In this repository, an issue is created for the vulnerability where 
   the impact and possible solutions are discussed.

4. The next step is to create a (draft) Github security advisory, which is only 
   visible to the repository administrators and community support team. 
   Severity and impact will be established here.

5. If appropriate, we request a 
   [CVE identifier](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/) from Github.

6. A patch is implemented, reviewed and tested in a private fork.

7. When the fix is tested and release coordination is done, the fix is merged 
   into the primary repository. The security advisory and release are 
   published. All managed instances should be updated.

8. The release and security vulnerability are communicated to the community. 
   This includes an announcement on [commonground.nl](https://commonground.nl).
