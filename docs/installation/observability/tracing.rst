Tracing
=======

.. note:: A vendor-agnostic implementation is under development. Currently you can
   already use Elastic APM.

Tracing makes it possible to follow the flow of requests across system boundaries,
e.g. from one application to another. This makes it possible to pinpoint where errors
or performance degrations are situated exactly. Trace IDs also make it possible to
correlate the relevant log entries.

.. note:: Better support for (distributed) traces is underway.
